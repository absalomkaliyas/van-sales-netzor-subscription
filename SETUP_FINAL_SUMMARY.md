## 📱 Mobile App Status

**Current**: Windows Expo bug prevents local startup
**Options**:
1. Test on physical device (Expo Go app) - works fine
2. Fix Windows bug later (find and replace `node:sea` → `node-sea`)
3. Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
4. Focus on admin portal first, mobile app later

**Mobile app code is ready** - just needs Expo to start properly.
